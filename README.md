### Core concepts

- <ins>***Mutex***</ins>
  - In computer programming, a mutual exclusion (mutex) is a program object that <ins>***prevents multiple threads from accessing the same shared resource simultaneously***</ins> . 
- <ins>***Shared Resource***</ins>
  - A shared resource in this context is a code element with a critical section, the part of the code that should not be executed by more than one thread at a time. 
  - For example, a critical section might update <ins>***a global variable***</ins>, modify <ins>***a table in a database***</ins> or write a file to a network server. 
  - In such cases, access to the shared resource must be controlled to prevent problems to the data or the program itself.
- <ins>***Mutex object***</ins>
  - A mutex is a mechanism used to ensure that multiple concurrent threads do not try to execute a critical section of code simultaneously.
- <ins>***Race condition***</ins>
  - If a mutex is not applied, the program might be subject to a race condition, a situation in which multiple threads try to access a shared resource at the same time. When this happens, unintended results can occur, such as data being read or written incorrectly or the program misbehaving or crashing.
  - So, in summary : Use a mutex when you (thread) want to execute code that should not be executed by any other thread at the same time.

- <ins>***What is a Thread?***</ins>
  - A thread is a single sequence stream within a process. 
  - Because threads have some of the properties of processes, they are sometimes called lightweight processes.
- <ins>***What are the differences between processes and thread?***</ins> 
  - Threads are not independent from each other unlike processes. 
  - As a result, threads shares with other threads their code section, data section and OS resources like open files and signals. 
  - But, like processes, a thread has its own program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space.
